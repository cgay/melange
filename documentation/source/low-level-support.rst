Low level support facilities
============================

The high level functions for calling C routines or for
accessing global variables are all built upon a relatively small
number of built-in primitives which perform specific low-level
tasks. You should seldom have any need to deal with these
primitives directly, but they are nonetheless available should
you need to make use of them.

TODO: Point to documentation on C-FFI and direct-c-ffi.
